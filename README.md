DATA SCIENCE ASSIGNMENT:- 
Part 1: Predict the price of a house
Problem statement: The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these
variables affect the house price.
Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the
accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending
the final prediction model
SOLUTION :-THE BEST MODEL FOR HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION IS MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION SINCE ERROR OBTAINED (7.730041269264831) IS LESS THAN OTHER PREDICTED MODEL (Ridge:-7.921809127589117),(Lasso:-8.122181444118207)
Part 2: Product matching product lists from Flipkart & Amazon
Problem statement:
Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. Please explore as
many techniques as possible before choosing the final technique.
SOLUTION :-19922 PRODUCTS WERE MATCHED BETWEEN AMAZON AND FLIPKART DATASET
